# Greater-Sydney-Quality-of-Life-Analysis

In this anaylsis, We worked with a variety of datatypes including **geojson**, **shape (.shp)**, and **csv** files. These datasets were uploaded into a local SQL server where we would later retreive the data for analysis. 

We then used this data to create a standardised "well resourced" score to determine the quality of life of each Greater Sydney Suburb.
